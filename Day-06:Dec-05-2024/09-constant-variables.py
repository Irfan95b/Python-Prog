    Constant Variables
    -------------------
        constant variables have fixed value through out the program and cannot be changed.

        Python does not support constant values in its variables.
        However we can achive this by using Block Letter variables 
            (Ex:- CONT_VAR = 120).
            But still we can modify these values, It is just to set som standerd.

PI = 3.14
print(PI)

MAX = 100  # But still we can change these values.
MIN = 0

PI = 3.20
print(PI)
