    Controle Structures:-
        Control-Structures also known as Flow-Controls in Python
        Control means <<Condition>>
            Ex:-
                (a<b):

                a = 234
                (a == 234):

        Structure means indented-block-of-code
            Ex:-
                (condition):
                    stmt 1;
                    stmt 2;
                    '           --> suite (indented block of code)
                    '
                    '
                    stmt n;

        Defenition:
            Executing an indented-block-of-code, based on <<condition>> is known as Control-Structure or Flow-Controls

        In Python, we dont have blocks with {} parethesis.
        Here we have indented-block-of-code
        single/multiple stmts with equal spaces from left is called suite or indented block of code.
        Flow-control means the order in which statements are executed in program.

   A) Conditional stmts                      b) Iterative stmts                         c) Transfer stmts
            or                                      or                                          or
